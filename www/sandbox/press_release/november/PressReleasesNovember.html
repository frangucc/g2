Despite that startup not really working out, he&rsquo;s confident that Lightbank will invest in him again.

He&rsquo;s also at the tail end of the millennial generation having been born in 1981. Frank is a highly technical and artistic founder who at age 19 became the the first self-taught technical analyst to work for Goldman &amp; Sachs without a degree.

His previous business fulfilled and sold goods to Groupon, Woot, Tanga, NoMoreRack and hundreds of other online retailers. For the past five years his company has consistently delivered hundreds of thousands of packages on behalf some of the worlds top eTailers. We estimate Brian&#39;s personal label printer (good old trusty), has printed over 1.4 million active labels since 2012.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The goal at ProblemSpaces appears to be the omnichannel Radio Shack isle for small electrical computing hardware and sensors. In less than a month, Brian has already helped us grow the inventory by 1500 SKUS and we&#39;re ready for pick and pack.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">ProblemSpaces CEO Frank Pinto and Brian Wasz&#39;s back story is rich and colorful. &quot;We started Dillyeo together in 2007 and got the business up and running. After a couple years, Frank moved on,&quot; explains Brian. &quot;In 2010 Frank was offered the opportunity to help Groupons venture capital firm Lightbank grow their portfolio and I think his decisions to do that have put him in the position he&#39;s in now, at just 33. We&#39;re both excited to be working again under one roof.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Frank has built more than a dozen companies for others. His claim to fame is that he started a daily deal business before Groupon, helped a dozen startups at Lightbank and got his first million from Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell in 2012. &quot;Looking back I&#39;m not sure how I even got my foot in the door,&quot; jokes Frank. &quot;But I&#39;m glad I did, because I learned a lot from people who were like Gods to me. My dudes over there have grit, and I might be the grittiest person ever. We&#39;re like jackrabbits in Chicago.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&quot;I sold Dillyeo to Brian in 2010, confident Brian would take it over, but I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d take the business to such new heights. The time has come for us to merge back our businesses and transition into something way more scalable than simply drop shipping and flipping. Everything we have learned over the years will be put to the test by ProblemSpaces.com.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The partnerships with the both Brian and Avanzato will guarantee a steady pipeline of customers, manufacturing oversight and parts procurement. With a touch of creativity on the content side we plan to bundle up Expansion Packs with a social gamification strategy. We think this might be a new paradigm for learning ECE, a booming new field that too many drop out of because they got involved too late.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Expansion Packs are akin to really good plugins for software which follow the convention over configuration paradigm coined by 37Signals&#39; Jason Fried and DHH, and are ultimately managed, by community, much like Gems, NPM or Bower packages. Bundling up heir hardware is what Brian has joined the company to focus on. They are ready now, we have them all prepared and are waiting for orders as of today, November 1st. Soon, others will be able to create them as well. We literally live with our customers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&quot;We want our customers spending more time tweaking their inventions and bringing them to life as opposed to just trying to get the devices powered or work properly. Our user research has shown that context, vanity and stimulation is key. With Expansion Packs, you unpack, complete the circuit and the payoff immediately starts rolling in. The only thing you need to do as a user is tweak the logic or make actions and callbacks to trigger other behaviors - we are two steps ahead of you as our user. This means that developers can make closed loop expansion packs for kids or enterprise that are extremely interactive. On blogs and instructable websites, this stuff is implemented really poorly, and it&#39;s not as social as you might think.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">If we can perfect this at scale, this could be a billion dollar enterprise. I don&#39;t think people understand we sell a 4&quot; cubed Linux workstation with an onboard microcontroller and breadboard, high resolution TFT screen and infinite expansion capabilities. It&#39;s technically an open source Robot that can handle physical and virtual tasks. These small nodes pack a punch in terms of performance and ship with a personality named Higgs, a persistent mentor that can be trained by it&rsquo;s owner.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 360.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 360.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c4">Our package manager is heavily integrated with APIs such as Githooks, IFTT and Zapier, so I&#39;m confident we&#39;re ready for press and to bring people aboard, especially developers.

We can&#39;t go wrong.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Brian was also the companies first money-in angel, so he&#39;s been familiar with the operation since inception. With Brian on board the company we will be able to put to work dozens of relationships, trade secrets, distribution expertise and sourcing skills.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&quot;Frank and Brian have a long history and a successful track record of investing as well. We made our first investment in the pair in 2007. We literally hunkered down on Clark and Van Buren and within 3-4 months our startup was doing a palette a day, by end of year one we were breaking down containers and by year three we had sometimes docked 5 and 6 semis per week. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The company to date has taken very little capital and come a long way on fumes. Constraints have been a good thing and have acted as a wind harness for the next few sprints. &quot;In terms of future investments, we are customer centric, so if raising capital puts our customers at an advantage, then we will consider. Right now, we don&#39;t have that problem, we are generating profit now and have a really clean burn. We have our work carved out for us for now and are looking forward to transacting with more and more customers and on gathering data,&quot; includes Frank.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&quot;Frank and I have remained friends through thick and thin. We are family, we&#39;ve been on tour together and have done battle, we both know what we need to do right now to level-up the company.

These dudes work hard and play hard.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">But Frank thinks this idea could be bigger than even all of us, including Avanzato, so he&#39;s decided to pitch Ycombinator and other groups, like Disney and Intel. &quot;We need trajectory and we need to meet the right people if we want to scale this business and deliver millions of nodes to people all around the World. We are going to need the Silicon Valley&#39;s support and we are prepared to move there now and have already opened a small office there.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&quot;Our business is to be in the business of organizing global problem spaces. We&#39;re meeting our customers at the cusp of innovation in a very special way. One we feel that is different from our competitors approach to youth and hacking. It&#39;s what sets us apart right now.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The product we&#39;ve created is necessary, meaning it&#39;s going to get really competitive, fast, and that&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll have to keep one-upping each other. With Brian on board, I don&#39;t have to worry about the supply chain side of the business as much. I can focus on which expansion packs need to be developed, creativity and on manufacturing unique products like the Node, our flagship product.&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">One thing is for sure, we aren&#39;t going to be one of these companies that raises millions of dollars and takes 2-3 years to deliver a product. We&#39;re already selling our by-products already and will be introducing our TackleBot product as a developer preview. We&#39;re stamping 500 of them right now, we&#39;ll be able to assemble 5k nodes by December. We are officially on our road to 50k units.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Thanks for reading and as always,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">++++ Run Fast, with Vision ++++</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">For press inquiries:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">frank@problespaces.com</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14"></span></p></body></html>
